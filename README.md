# WhoAmI
 Text-Based Adventure Game Collaboration Between: Dalton Hodkiewicz, Vivian Gomez, Kyler Lambert

Goals for Team:
--
Try to document every variable- every method (if you look at the code right now it's not that way but I will be making a conscious effort to explain everything)

Random idea
--
He mentioned this in class, I love the idea and it's kind of brutal but makes for multiple endings and would be easy.. Let's have 1 out of 100 chance you open a door or go through a door and you go fall deeper into the abyss- (Game over) type scenario- but allows for a failed (frustratingly so- type ending)
