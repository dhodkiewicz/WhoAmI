# WhoAmI
 Text-Based Adventure Game Collaboration Between: Dalton Hodkiewicz, Vivian Gomez, Kyler Lambert

Goals for Team:
--
Try to document every variable- every method (if you look at the code right now it's not that way but I will be making a conscious effort to explain everything)

What Do you do?
--
Whatever you want. Make a new branch- start making changes on that branch or implementing things. If something isn't making sense that's okay- just reach out on discord I'll answer more than likely within 24 hours.

Random idea(s)
--
He mentioned this in class, I love the idea and it's kind of brutal but makes for multiple endings and would be easy.. Let's have 1 out of 100 chance you open a door or go through a door and you go fall deeper into the abyss- (Game over) type scenario- but allows for a failed (frustratingly so- type ending)

How will player/user move?
--

I think i'll have keybindings for arrows- so instead of "look right" "move north" we are going to have it where if you move right the system will simply print- step north- step west- step south- etc. 

If a player hits an object it will make a sound- each object/npc bumped into will make a different sound (like "orkk") if it's an orc- or "bump" if it's a wall or "knock" if it's a door- etc.

I'll be adding another file in the repo called story. It can be collaborative too! Don't feel afraid to say something seems dumb or doesn't make sense, because the last thing I want is for either of you to feel 100% lost. I'm not your employer, just a fellow student. We are in this together and any and all help will be extremely appreciated. Let's try to make this fun and not wait until the very end so we aren't more stressed than we need to be.
