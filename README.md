 Text-Based Adventure Game Collaboration Between: Dalton Hodkiewicz, Vivian Gomez, Kyler Lambert

Goals for Team:
--
Try to document thoroughly, as I will do the same. Let's try to keep consistency and not have properties that names that don't make sense. I don't mind if you are lax on temporary variables, but for sake of readability for my temporary/placeholder variables I try to name them as such for inst tempName, tempLocation, etc so that way you can sort of derive what it's purpose serves without having to think too much!

What Do you do?
--
Whatever you want. Make a new branch- start making changes on that branch or implementing things. If something isn't making sense that's okay- just reach out on discord I'll answer more than likely within 24 hours.

I use GitHub for desktop, I essentially made a repository, then put or created my project within the repository. It watches the repository for any changes that are saved and instantly highlights the changes. You will essentially be working on your own branch of the repository but it still will be the same repository- just a branch off of it. So when you make changes you will be submitting your branch changes and then we will merge them. If it doesn't make sense watch this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPagOAUx2SQ&t=419s

Step 1
--
Create branch- ideas for name convention can just be your names

Step 2
--
When you make changes locally you push them to your branch. You are now all added as contributors and the repo is public so you should be able to merge your own branch. Try to do merges with the main often, also any time you do a merge let's let eachother know via our discord so that way we don't run into conflicts. Let's try to do too much at a time as each branch theoretically should be for a feature, that way we know you are working on one thing or one general area and can avoid making conflicting changes amongst ourselves.




Random idea(s)
--
He mentioned this in class, I love the idea and it's kind of brutal but makes for multiple endings and would be easy.. Let's have 1 out of 100 chance you open a door or go through a door and you go fall deeper into the abyss- (Game over) type scenario- but allows for a failed (frustratingly so- type ending)

How will player/user move?
--

player will be moving via command. Initially planned on using keyboard but personally, although I know how to make forms it's not necessary for this project and we can work on having an absolute beast of a console project, which is cool.

Let's focus on Story later, and foundation first. As long as we can understand the player movements/interactions etc, we can focus on dialog later. Kind of the beauty of the title is, we don't really want the character to know who/what they are right away.
