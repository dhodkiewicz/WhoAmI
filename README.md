# WhoAmI
 Text-Based Adventure Game Collaboration Between: Dalton Hodkiewicz, Vivian Gomez, Kyler Lambert

Goals for Team:
--
Try to document every variable- every method (if you look at the code right now it's not that way but I will be making a conscious effort to explain everything)

What Do you do?
--
Whatever you want. Make a new branch- start making changes on that branch or implementing things. If something isn't making sense that's okay- just reach out on discord I'll answer more than likely within 24 hours.

I use GitHub for desktop, I essentially made a repository, then put or created my project within the repository. It watches the repository for any changes that are saved and instantly highlights the changes. You will essentially be working on your own branch of the repository but it still will be the same repository- just a branch off of it. So when you make changes you will be submitting your branch changes and then we will merge them. If it doesn't make sense watch this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPagOAUx2SQ&t=419s

Step 1
--
Create branch- ideas for name convention can just be your names

Step 2
--
When you make changes locally you push them to the repository

Step 3
--
Essentially, I'll look at the work and choose to merge it with the main branch- sometime's there can be conflicts, but hopefully there won't be :) I try to honestly do pushes pretty frequently so that way I know that my stuff is working and that work is saved and updated frequently.



Random idea(s)
--
He mentioned this in class, I love the idea and it's kind of brutal but makes for multiple endings and would be easy.. Let's have 1 out of 100 chance you open a door or go through a door and you go fall deeper into the abyss- (Game over) type scenario- but allows for a failed (frustratingly so- type ending)

How will player/user move?
--

I think i'll have keybindings for arrows- so instead of "look right" "move north" we are going to have it where if you move right the system will simply print- step north- step west- step south- etc. 

If a player hits an object it will make a sound- each object/npc bumped into will make a different sound (like "orkk") if it's an orc- or "bump" if it's a wall or "knock" if it's a door- etc.

I'll be adding another file in the repo called story. It can be collaborative too! Don't feel afraid to say something seems dumb or doesn't make sense, because the last thing I want is for either of you to feel 100% lost. I'm not your employer, just a fellow student. We are in this together and any and all help will be extremely appreciated. Let's try to make this fun and not wait until the very end so we aren't more stressed than we need to be.
